Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.
Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
  An advantage of offering refactored code is that it can often times clean up the code and make it more refined.  Along with that is the code can be eaiser to read and run better.  A disadvantage of this is intorducing new bugs into the code.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
  In our example refactoring the code proved to bring several new bugs into the VBA.  When first running the program I was able to do so without many difficulting but after refactoring the code it became much more of a challange.
  The pros of going with refactoring is that we were able to have a more refined program.  Thay also allowed for our VBA script to preform more efficently.
